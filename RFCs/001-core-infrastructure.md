# RFC 001: Core Infrastructure Setup

## Priority: P0

Implementation timeline: Week 1-2

## Overview

This RFC outlines the initial setup of core infrastructure components required for the AR Menu application.

## Goals

- Set up basic project structure
- Implement core security features
- Configure database and storage systems
- Establish development environment

## Detailed Design

### Project Structure

```
/frontend
  /components
  /pages
  /public
    /assets
    /models
    /qrcodes
/backend
  /api
  /models
  /services
  /utils
/storage
  /models
  /qrcodes
  /uploads
```

### Security Implementation [MVP]

- HTTPS setup with self-signed certificates
- Basic file upload validation
- Input sanitization implementation

### Database Setup [MVP]

- PostgreSQL database initialization
- Basic schema migrations
- Data validation implementation

### Storage System [MVP]

- Local storage configuration
- File organization structure
- Basic file management utilities

### Development Environment

- Next.js setup with Tailwind CSS
- FastAPI backend configuration
- Development server configuration
- Local SSL certificate generation

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend Setup

- Next.js@latest
- Tailwind CSS
- Basic component structure
- Development server with HTTPS

### Backend Setup

- FastAPI framework
- PostgreSQL connection
- Basic API structure
- File handling utilities

### Security Configuration

- SSL/TLS setup
- Basic security headers
- CORS configuration
- File upload restrictions

## Implementation Plan

1. Project Scaffolding (Day 1-2)

   - Create directory structure
   - Initialize frontend and backend projects
   - Set up version control
2. Security Setup (Day 3-4)

   - Generate SSL certificates
   - Configure HTTPS
   - Implement basic security measures
3. Database Implementation (Day 5-7)

   - Set up PostgreSQL
   - Create initial schemas
   - Implement basic migrations
4. Storage System (Day 8-10)

   - Configure local storage
   - Implement file management
   - Set up basic utilities

## Success Criteria

- [ ] HTTPS working with self-signed certificates
- [ ] Database connections functional
- [ ] File upload system operational
- [ ] Development environment fully configured
- [ ] Basic security measures implemented

## Future Considerations

- Cloud storage integration
- Advanced security features
- Scalability improvements
- Monitoring system
