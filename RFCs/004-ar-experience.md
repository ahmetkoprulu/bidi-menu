# RFC 004: AR Experience Implementation

## Priority: P0
Implementation timeline: Week 4-5

## Overview
This RFC details the implementation of the AR experience, including camera interface, location-based features, and 3D model interaction.

## Goals
- Implement full-screen camera interface
- Develop location-based AR features
- Create 3D model interaction system
- Establish menu visualization interface

## Detailed Design

### Camera Interface [MVP]
- Full-screen camera view
- Permission handling
- Surface detection
- Performance optimization

### Location-Based Features [MVP]
```javascript
// Location Service Structure
class LocationService {
  constructor() {
    this.gps = null;
    this.compass = null;
    this.surfaces = [];
  }

  initializeGPS()
  initializeCompass()
  trackSurfaces()
  calculateDistance()
}
```

### 3D Model Interaction [MVP]
- Tap to place functionality
- Pinch to resize
- Rotation controls
- Surface snapping

### Menu Visualization [MVP]
- Floating menu interface
- Smooth scrolling list
- Model preview
- Basic filtering

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend Components [MVP]
- AR.js integration
- Camera permission handler
- Location service
- Model interaction controls
- Menu overlay

### AR Configuration [MVP]
```javascript
const arConfig = {
  locationBased: true,
  surfaceDetection: true,
  maxDistance: 100, // meters
  minAccuracy: 5, // meters
};
```

### Data Flow [MVP]
```
1. Initialize AR -> Get Permissions -> Start Camera
2. Track Location -> Detect Surfaces -> Calculate Distances
3. Load Menu -> Display Interface -> Handle Interactions
4. Place Model -> Handle Transformations -> Update View
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Camera Setup (Day 1-3)
   - Implement camera interface
   - Add permission handling
   - Set up surface detection
   - Basic performance optimization

2. Location Features (Day 4-6)
   - GPS integration
   - Compass setup
   - Surface tracking
   - Distance calculations

3. Model Interaction (Day 7-8)
   - Implement placement
   - Add transformation controls
   - Surface snapping
   - Interaction feedback

4. Menu Interface (Day 9-10)
   - Create floating menu
   - Implement scrolling
   - Add model preview
   - Basic filtering

## API Endpoints [MVP]

### Location
```
GET /api/location/calibrate
POST /api/location/update
```

### AR State
```
GET /api/ar/state
POST /api/ar/update
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Camera permission and access working
- [ ] Location tracking functional
- [ ] Surface detection reliable
- [ ] Model placement and interaction smooth
- [ ] Menu interface responsive

## Performance Requirements [MVP]
- Camera initialization: < 2 seconds
- Surface detection: < 1 second
- Model placement: < 500ms
- Interface response: < 100ms
- Location update: < 1 second

## Future Considerations
- Multi-model placement
- Advanced lighting
- Gesture recognition
- Environment mapping
- Offline support
